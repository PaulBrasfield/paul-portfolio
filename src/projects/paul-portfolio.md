### Project Description

This project is actually this very site. I built my own personal website to host a portfolio of my projects and other services, mostly as a way to keep everything organized and have a central place to direct potential clients and employers to learn more about me. This project began in March 2022 and was completed in April 2022.

### Project Link

You are already viewing the live project, but you can find the source code on my [**GitHub**](https://github.com/PaulBrasfield/paul-portfolio).

### Tech Stack

    - React 17.0.1

    - Gatsby 4.12.1

    - Netlify

I built this project using mainly React and Gatsby. Each project page is dynamically generated via templates and GraphQL queries to build the page at load time from markdown files containing details about each project. This project also uses React Routing for site navigation, meaning that each page is loaded within the app so that we cut down on how many server
calls are being made. Finally, simple CSS was used to style each page, with media queries used as needed for responsiveness and accessibility for various devices. This project was deployed using Netlify, making use of Continuous Deployment by linking the GitHub repository to the app.
